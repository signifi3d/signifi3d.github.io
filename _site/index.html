<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/pickerupper">Ethernet Frame Picker-upper</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspects all incoming ethernet frames in userspace and filters out any frames that would normally be dropped due to bad checksums. Mostly made due to curiousity. Requires network interfaces that allow turning on rx-fcs and rx-all options.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/jwt-edit">jwt-edit</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Useful for quickly editing and viewing JWT Tokens on the command line. It changes or adds fields, builds the new hash with or without a provided key, and prints out the new token ready to use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/permutatertot">permutatertot</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes in a mapping of characters to replacements and outputs every combination of possible replacements for every word in a provided wordlist. Made for situations where hashcat isn’t practically flexible enough.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/rc4crack">rc4crack</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Useful tool for trying to crack very simple RC4 cipher keys and their encrypted data given only the data. Can use a wordlist or bruteforce the key. It runs through the keys and will output possible messages with printable characters.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://signifi3d.github.io/hugo-demo/index.html">Hugo - A Map of Multnomah County Health Inspection Data (project source)</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Made to make health data more accessible, this project involved scraping data from the Multnomah County Health Department and mapping the permitted facilities along with their inspection ratings. Absolutely a reference to the health inspector from Bob’s Burgers.</li>
      <li>Learned about marrying together the acquisition of data and its presentation with automated processes utilizing several different services and format conversions. I have since stopped updating the data for this project to reduce the strain on the Health Department’s web site.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/fxor">fxor</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Made to perform a xor operations on entire files in the case of simple encryption schemes. There are better options out there now.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/koikeizer">koikeizer</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Cuts an image into strips and collates them in multiple ways. Inspired by the art of Kensuke Koike.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/farkle-strategizer">Farkle Strategizer</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The video game Kingdom Come allows you to gamble on a simplified version of the dice game Farkle to make money, which can be very difficult at the beginning of the game. I made this in order to develop optimal strategies for winning at Farkle. Makes use of OOP principles to program different strategies and pit them against each other in large numbers of simulations to see which method yields the most wins.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/picma-solver">Picma Solver</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Picture enigma puzzles give you a square grid with numbers along each row and column explaining how many squares in the grid are filled in on that particular line. From that information you fill in the grid to form a picture. They are made with both single and multiple colored squares.</li>
      <li>I took all of the strategies I use while solving these puzzles and coded them into Picma Solver to complete one-colored puzzles. It solves all but the hardest Picma puzzles of any grid size, and exhausts all of the typical strategies to give you a good start towards solving the hardest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/signifi3d/click-and-drag-ocr">Click and Drag OCR Copy</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Solves the practical problem of needing text data from images. Cross-platform tool designed to be bound to a keyboard shortcut so you can quickly press it, click and drag over the text you want to copy, it performs the OCR and copies the output text onto the clipboard. Learned about using Tesseract OCR, tkinter, and pyautogui.</li>
    </ul>
